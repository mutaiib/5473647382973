    <p class="main-1">Three Days Of Purification</p>
    <p>
        In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful <br>
Abstain from sexual desires, abstain from ill-speech, and most importantly abstain from food for 
three consecutive days. Three days of purification, purifies your spirit from worldly activities. It <
prepares your soul for the ultimate trial that will befall mankind in the coming years, if not months.
Praising and praying is necessary for this purification to take place. Number 3, plays an important
role in esoteric traditions and it also represents the three essences which are present in all living and
non-living substances. Salt, Spirit and Mercury. These three constitute everything that has existence
on the physical plane.<br>
The goal of this purification is to communicate with your personal spirit, your personal master, or
you can say your personal guardian Angel. The goal is to find answers from Allah through your
master. Don’t contact your master for mundane questions. You need your master, and your master
needs you. The feelings are mutual. Contact when only necessary and always be sure if you are
talking to an Angel or a Djinn.<br>
O, citizen of the Cosmos, Keep Allah in your mind always. Don’t fall into the trap set by the devil,
as many of us fall into the trap without knowing it. Keep Al-’Aleem in your prayers and in your
mind always. Be religious. I, Ruhan, share the wisdom that I have gathered over the years, only
because I am fearful of Al’-Aleem.<br>
