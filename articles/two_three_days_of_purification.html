    <p class="main-1">Three Days Of Purification</p>
    <p>
        In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful <br>
Abstain from sexual desires, abstain from ill-speech, and most importantly abstain from food for <br>
three consecutive days. Three days of purification, purifies your spirit from worldly activities. It <br>
prepares your soul for the ultimate trial that will befall mankind in the coming years, if not months.<br>
Praising and praying is necessary for this purification to take place. Number 3, plays an important<br>
role in esoteric traditions and it also represents the three essences which are present in all living and<br>
non-living substances. Salt, Spirit and Mercury. These three constitute everything that has existence<br>
on the physical plane.<br>
The goal of this purification is to communicate with your personal spirit, your personal master, or<br>
you can say your personal guardian Angel. The goal is to find answers from Allah through your<br>
master. Don’t contact your master for mundane questions. You need your master, and your master<br>
needs you. The feelings are mutual. Contact when only necessary and always be sure if you are<br>
talking to an Angel or a Djinn.<br>
O, citizen of the Cosmos, Keep Allah in your mind always. Don’t fall into the trap set by the devil,<br>
as many of us fall into the trap without knowing it. Keep Al-’Aleem in your prayers and in your<br>
mind always. Be religious. I, Ruhan, share the wisdom that I have gathered over the years, only<br>
because I am fearful of Al’-Aleem.<br>
