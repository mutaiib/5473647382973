      <p class="main-1">Searching For Divine Inspiration</p>
      <p>I see myself as a true Muslim.
          When I talk about meta-physical principles, 
      how I can search for divine inspiration through meditation,
      and remembering Allah 
      in small acts that I perform from day to day basis, 
      people from various sects like to brand me as a Sufi Philosopher. 
      I don’t see myself as a Sufi, I see myself as a practicing 
      Alchemist and a true Muslim. <br>
      
      Isolation is important. It makes you realise the true nature of 
      things and it helps you see right through the veil of deception put forth by Iblis.
      <br>
      There is a divine essence in all of us. 
      Without this essence we would never be able to defeat the dark forces.
      This essence activates or kindles 
      only when we start striving for Light through worshipping the 
      supreme being, Allah. Divine inspiration comes from Allah. 
      There is a false inspiration, which comes from the devil, 
      but a true believer can easily differentiate between these two inspirations. 
      <br>
      I was on the dark path, before resurrecting as a new human being.
      It was as if I was reborn and I started percieving matters, or 
      things, from a different perspective. Dark path is not necessary but 
      it  enables us to differentiate between what is right and what is wrong.
      However, not everyone who follows the dark path ressurects as a new 
      vessel. And if you find yourself to be in darkness or under dark forces, 
      seek help from your master. Dark path is not the path you consciouly choose 
      to follow, rather the philosophical dragons obliterate you to the 
      point where you find your existence worthless and nothing around you makes sense. 
      This is a trap. These feelings channel out through anger and
        you seem to find the whole society working against you. But this is not true, 
        nobody is against you. 
      This is the moment where you have infinite power to either resurrect as an immortal
      being or else a mortal sinful little creature that only 
      deserves hell and absolute torture, but i pray for those lost souls
      because it is not really their fault, i blame the cursed Satan. 
      I see these men/women as weak mortal creatures who have lost their divine
      essence by following their desires rather than what is just and right. 
      You are an infinite being and you can turn your life upside down, if you
      are willing and ready to change. Transformation is necessary. 
      Our brains are wired to change meta-physcially with respect to time. 
      <br>
      There is Light and there is Darkness. 
      For a single thing can’t exist on it’s own, except Ar-Rahman. 
      Suffering exists because everything moves with respect to “time”. 
      You take, time, out from this reality, 
      suffering will vanish as if it wasn’t present in the first place. 
      Time tests us. It tests us in ways  we can’t even imagine. 
      It keeps us locked in this matrix. The concept of time ends when 
      we start to levitate vertically through/on vertical axis. 
      This axis connects the two opposite poles or two opposite dimenions, 
      Above and below. Above is where we are supposed to reside
      after the concept of Time is destroyed. Just like Light and darkness, 
      there is Above and below. This principle is also described in The Kybalion,
        the principle of Polarity - 
        <br>
      <p class="quotes"> 
      <em><q class="">
      Everything is dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature,
      but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half‑truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.</q></em> The Kybalion<br> </p>
