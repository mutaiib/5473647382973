    <p class="main-1">Searching For Divine Inspiration</p>
    <p>I see myself as a true Muslim.<br>
         When I talk about meta-physical principles, <br>
    how I can search for divine inspiration through meditation,<br>
     and remembering Allah <br>
    in small acts that I perform from day to day basis, <br>
    people from various sects like to brand me as a Sufi Philosopher. <br>
    I don’t see myself as a Sufi, I see myself as a practicing <br>
    Alchemist and a true Muslim. <br>
    <br>
    Isolation is important. It makes you realise the true nature of <br>
    things and it helps you see right through the veil of deception put forth by Iblis.<br> 
    <br>
    There is a divine essence in all of us. <br>
    Without this essence we would never be able to defeat the dark forces.<br>
     This essence activates or kindles <br>
    only when we start striving for Light through worshipping the <br>
    supreme being, Allah. Divine inspiration comes from Allah. <br>
    There is a false inspiration, which comes from the devil, <br>
    but a true believer can easily differentiate between these two inspirations. <br>
    <br>
    I was on the dark path, before resurrecting as a new human being.<br>
     It was as if I was reborn and I started percieving matters, or <br>
    things, from a different perspective. Dark path is not necessary but <br>
    it  enables us to differentiate between what is right and what is wrong.<br>
     However, not everyone who follows the dark path ressurects as a new <br>
     vessel. And if you find yourself to be in darkness or under dark forces, <br>
     seek help from your master. Dark path is not the path you consciouly choose <br>
     to follow, rather the philosophical dragons obliterate you to the <br>
     point where you find your existence worthless and nothing around you makes sense. <br>
     This is a trap. These feelings channel out through anger and<br>
      you seem to find the whole society working against you. But this is not true, <br>
      nobody is against you. <br>
    This is the moment where you have infinite power to either resurrect as an immortal<br>
     being or else a mortal sinful little creature that only <br>
    deserves hell and absolute torture, but i pray for those lost souls<br>
     because it is not really their fault, i blame the cursed Satan. <br>
    I see these men/women as weak mortal creatures who have lost their divine <br>
    essence by following their desires rather than what is just and right. <br>
    You are an infinite being and you can turn your life upside down, if you<br>
    are willing and ready to change. Transformation is necessary. <br>
    Our brains are wired to change meta-physcially with respect to time. <br>
    <br>
    There is Light and their is Darkness. <br>
    For a single thing can’t exist on it’s own, except Ar-Rahman. <br>
    Suffering exists because everything moves with respect to “time”. <br>
    You take, time, out from this reality, <br>
    suffering will vanish as if it wasn’t present in the first place. <br>
    Time tests us. It tests us in ways  we can’t even imagine. <br>
    It keeps us locked in this matrix. The concept of time ends when <br>
    we start to levitate vertically through/on vertical axis. <br>
    This axis connects the two opposite poles or two opposite dimenions, <br>
    Above and below. Above is where we are supposed to reside<br>
     after the concept of Time is destroyed. Just like Light and darkness, <br>
     there is Above and below. This principle is also described in The Kybalion,<br>
      the principle of Polarity - <br>
      <br>

    <q><em>
    Everything is dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature,
     but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half‑truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.</q></em> The Kybalion<br>
